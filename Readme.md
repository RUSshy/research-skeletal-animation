# 3D Skeletal Animation research project

See [seanjoflynn.com/research/skeletal-animation](http://www.seanjoflynn.com/research/skeletal-animation) for the full write up.

# Purpose

The aim of this project was to gain a better understanding of how computers store and display 3D models and animations â€“ particularly skeletal animations where only a skeleton is animation and the model moves with the skeleton. I used C# as it's the language I'm most familiar with.
